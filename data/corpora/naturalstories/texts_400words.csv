1,"If you were to journey to the North of England, you would come to a valley that is surrounded by moors as high as mountains. It is in this valley where you would find the city of Bradford, where once a thousand spinning jennies that hummed and clattered spun wool into money for the long-bearded mill owners. That all mill owners were generally busy as beavers and quite pleased with themselves for being so successful and well off was known to the residents of Bradford, and if you were to go into the city to visit the stately City Hall, you would see there the Crest of the City of Bradford, which those same mill owners created to celebrate their achievements. It shows a sinister looking boar's head sitting on top of a well which seems puzzling at first, but the reason for this symbol is a matter of legend. There was once, legend has it, a fearsome boar, which lived in a wood located just outside the manor of Bradford. A source of great trouble to the local folk the boar was, bringing terror to the peaceful flocks and ravaging the countryside around. Even worse, however, the boar most liked to go to the well that was in the wood and drink its fresh water, so that the people of Bradford had second thoughts about visiting the well. That the people of Bradford bore the brunt of the beast's ferocity was unfair in the eyes of the people of the region. Eventually, the issue reached the ears of the kindly Lord of the Manor who the people had often asked for help. The Lord saw the severity of the problem the people faced and suggested a contest could solve the problem. He said that whoever could kill the boar and bring as proof its head to the Manor House would be rewarded with land and fame. It was the people of Bradford and the people who knew them who rejoiced at this proclamation but one question remained: who would kill the boar? By the handsome reward many felt tempted, but the thought of the boar with its deadly tusks and face like thunder soon put an end to their ambitions. However, there was one huntsman, who was still wet behind the ears, who decided the prize was worth a shot, in spite of the boar's reputation. The huntsman discovered"
2,"A clear and joyous day it was and out on the wide open sea, thousands upon thousands of sparkling water drops, excited by getting to play in the ocean, danced all around. One of these was a merry little fellow named Aqua, who danced on the silver backs of the fishes as they plunged up and down in the waves, and, no matter how high he sprung, he always came down again into his mother's lap. His mother, you know, was the ocean, and very beautiful she looked that summer day in her dark blue dress and white ruffles. By and by, the happy water drop tired of his play, and looking up to the clear sky above him, thought he would like to have a sail on one of the white, marshmallow-like clouds, instead of spending his whole life in the ocean. Of the sky, little Aqua had always been afraid, but he decided to finally face his demons and suggested a solution involving the sun carrying him up to the sky would be ideal. The sun understood Aqua's request came from his heart, so he acquiesced and also took ever so many other drops, so that Aqua might not be lonesome on the way. It was only the sun that knew this, however, for all the other drops had been changed into fine mist or vapor and Aqua could not see them. Do you know what vapor is? If you breathe into the air, when it is cold enough, you will see it coming out of your mouth thick and fast like steam. When the vapor is quite near the earth, we call it 'fog'. Into vapor the water drops that danced in the ocean had been changed, because in their own shape they were too heavy for the sunbeams that the sun let out to carry. Higher and higher they sailed, and though it was grand, Aqua and his friends were like fish out of water, so they grew quite dizzy. They enjoyed looking down on the world below, while the wind scattered them across the four corners of the earth, but after a while it grew nearly time for the sun to go to bed. He became very red in the face, and began to sink lower and lower, until suddenly he went clear out of sight! Poor little Aqua, frightened by the impending cold and"
3,"It was cold and nearly dark on the last evening of the old year, and the snow was falling fast and furious. A little girl no one sheltered from the gelid air roamed through the streets with a bare head and naked feet, looking as poor as a church mouse. It's true she had on a pair of slippers her mother had once given her when she left home, but they were as much use to her as a chocolate teapot. The slippers owned by her mother were so large that the emaciated little creature had lost them while running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other, saying that he could use it as a home for his little pet mouse. So with her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold, the little girl went on, wondering how she would get through this dreadful night. She approached an old hovel she had used as a shelter a few times before, and found the entrance was locked. Tough luck for the girl! This day was even worse than the others. No Good Samaritan had given her even a penny. And she had no luck selling any matches that she carried in the old apron her grandmother had given her. Poor little child, she looked the picture of misery. On her long, fair hair, which hung in curls on her shoulders, the snowflakes kept landing, but she did not notice them as she shivered along. She was losing strength and beginning to doubt she could weather this storm. It was New Year's, and the girl asked herself why, as lights shone from every window, and the savory smell of roast goose crept out on the streets, she was outside all alone. Exhausted, she finally sat down in a corner behind the little bakery. She put a rag she had found over her legs to cover herself, but she could not keep off the cold. The girl, who the night air had completely enveloped, dared not go home, for she had sold no matches. Her father had been mean and moody ever since his wife had gone to meet her Maker. He would certainly beat her, as he has done several times in the weeks past,"
4,"Once upon a time the birds took it into their heads that they would like a master, and that one of their number must be chosen king. A meeting of all the birds was called and though they understood the birds who were from the most distant lands would be unable to come, many birds came from faraway meadows and woods. The eagle, who already thought himself the de facto king, arrived fashionably late. It was a hawk who was most excited about the meeting, because he was the dark horse for king. The small fry came too, and the robin, the bluebird, the owl, the lark, and the sparrow, who had only a chance in a million to be king, were all present at the meeting. The cuckoo, who was almost not invited because his call so annoyed the other birds, came too. It was the very little bird who had no name at all, however, that would end up overturning the balance of power among the birds. That there would be great confusion and noise among the birds at the meeting was to be expected, given the sheer numbers of birds that have gathered. There was piping, hissing, and clacking, but finally it was decided that the bird that could fly the highest should be king. The little bird lay low near the eagle at first, but the eagle did not notice the bird hopping onto his back right as the competition was about to commence. Into the air in a great flock all the birds flew when the signal was given. The air was full of dust, and it seemed as if a black cloud were floating over the field. You could hear the birds chirping and flapping from fields that were miles away. The little birds that soon grew tired fell back quickly to earth. The fact that the larger ones held out longer, and flew higher and higher, but the eagle flew highest of any, surprised no one. Could anyone stop the eagle that seemed to be flying straight into the sun? The other birds gave out one by one and when the eagle saw this he thought, 'What is the use of flying any higher? This victory is in the bag and I am king!' Then the birds below called with one accord, 'Come back, come back! It is you who must be our"
5,"At ten years old, I could not figure out what it was that this Elvis Presley guy had that the rest of us boys did not have. He seemed to be no different from the rest of us. He was simply a man who had a head, two arms and two legs. It must have been something pretty superlative that he had hidden away, because he had every young girl at the orphanage wrapped around his little finger. At about nine o'clock on Saturday morning, I figured a good solution was to ask Eugene Correthers, who was one of the older and smarter boys, what it was that made this Elvis guy so special. He told me that it was not anything about Elvis's personality, but his wavy hair, and the way he moved his body. About a half an hour later, the boys in the orphanage called down to the main dining room by the matron were told that they were all going to downtown Jacksonville, Florida to get a new pair of Buster Brown shoes and a haircut. That is when I got this big idea, which hit me like a ton of bricks. If the Elvis haircut was the big secret, then Elvis's haircut I was going to get. I was going to have my day in the sun, and all the way to town that was all I talked about. The fact that I was getting an Elvis haircut, not just the simple fact that we were getting out of the orphanage, made me particularly loquacious. I told everybody, including the orphanage matron I normally feared, that I was going to look just like Elvis Presley and that I would learn to move around just like he did and that I would be rich and famous one day, just like him. The matron understood my idea was something that I was really excited about and said nothing. When I got my new Buster Brown shoes, I was smiling from ear to ear. Those shoes, they shined really brightly, and I liked looking at the bones in my feet, which I had never seen before, through a special x-ray machine they had in the shoe store that made the bones in your feet look green. I was now almost ready to go back to the orphanage and practice being like the man who all the girls loved,"
6,"This is a story of how Mr. Sticky got in Abby's fish tank. 'He's very small,' Abby's mom said as she peered at the tiny water snail. Abby said that he would grow and then pulled her pajama bottoms up again before she got into bed, for they were always falling down. Usually, Abby's mom got up at the crack of dawn, but it was Abby who jumped out of bed first the next morning and switched on the light in her fish tank, which contained three fish. At first, she could see neither hide nor hair of the snail, but then she spotted him. It had taken Abby a while to find Sticky because he was clinging to the glass near the bottom, right next to the gravel. At school that day, Abby, encouraged by her teacher, wrote excitedly about the small and mysterious Mr. Sticky, who you could mistake for a piece of gravel. He seemed an ideal pet for her, some of the girls in her class teased, because Abby was also very small. That evening, Abby turned on the light and found Mr. Sticky clinging to the pond weed and bobbing about in the air bubbles. 'That looks fun!' Abby exclaimed. She tried to imagine what it must be like to have to hang on to things all day and decided the answer was that it was probably very tiring. Abby told her mom that she thought Sticky had grown a bit the next day at breakfast. 'Just as well if he's going to be gobbled up like that,' her mom responded who was busy preparing breakfast. Abby whined that she didn't want him to get too big or he wouldn't be cute anymore. 'Small things, not big things, are cute, right?' she asked, half to herself. The next day in art class, Abby needed two pieces of paper that were very expensive, to draw an elephant, but the teacher didn't mind Abby using the expensive paper because she was pleased with the drawing and wanted it on the wall. The teacher, who was always very encouraging, remarked that the drawing Abby had made was very creative and beamed at Abby, giving her the seal of approval. Back at home, Mom, convinced by Abby to clean out the tank, was cleaning with a special vacuum, or 'hoover'. 'Where's Mr. Sticky?' Abby asked first thing when she"
7,"The text message said that Lucy Josephs was a failure. It said she was ugly, had no style and the world hated her. At least that was what it said to Lucy. It said that and a whole lot more that she was struggling to understand. The actual text of the note said that Lucy better not show up at the party tonight, because it was going to be bad enough already! Lucy, who had started receiving these messages a few weeks ago, tapped the mobile screen to make the message disappear from view. She only wished it was as easy to tap her heart and erase the trace the message had left there. 'Was that another one of those messages?' her mom asked, who was driving the car. Lucy confirmed her mother's suspicion was founded as she answered dejectedly, 'I'm sorry to say it was.' 'Haven't you reported it yet?' asked Jill, Lucy's older sister who was sitting in the passenger seat. 'Yes,' Lucy replied, lying through her teeth. That Lucy should not let the messages get to her and that the sender was only jealous were Lucy's mom's arguments, in an effort to comfort her daughter. Lucy's mom suddenly felt guilty, for she had been the one to buy the phone for Lucy just a couple of months ago. She then admitted her regret about the phone was still bugging her out loud as she sighed, 'I never should have given you that phone Lucy.' 'No, it's fine. I love it,' said Lucy knowing that affording the phone had been no small thing for her mother. It had been nothing but trouble though. Lucy did not know who it was that was sending her the messages, and she did not know how they had got her number, but whoever it was, he or she had slowly taken over Lucy's life. She was getting several texts a day now, all of which were abusive and hurtful. Lucy wondered what the person who was messaging her might be thinking or trying to achieve with all of their hateful messages. As the car pulled up outside the school, which looked like a large shadow in the darkness of a November evening, Lucy felt a shiver run down her spine. Hastened by Jill, who did not want to be late to her own concert, Lucy hesitantly stepped out of the car and"
8,"The Roswell UFO Incident was the alleged recovery of extra-terrestrial debris, including alien corpses, from an object that crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, on or about July eighth, nineteen forty-seven. Since the late nineteen seventies, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and the subject of conspiracy theories as to the true nature of the object that crashed. The United States military maintains the debris recovered was from an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon that belonged to a classified program named 'Mogul'. However, many UFO proponents maintain that, in fact, a crashed alien craft and bodies were recovered, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. The incident has turned into a widely known pop culture phenomenon, making the name Roswell synonymous with UFOs. It ranks as one of the most publicized and controversial alleged UFO incidents. On July ninth, nineteen forty-seven, a press release that Roswell Army Air Field issued stated that personnel from the field's Bomb Group had recovered a crashed 'flying disc' from a ranch near Roswell, sparking intense media interest. Later the same day, the Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force stated that, in fact, a weather balloon had been recovered by the Roswell Army Air Field personnel, rather than a 'flying saucer'. A subsequent press conference was called, featuring debris from the crashed object that confirmed the weather balloon description. The case was quickly forgotten and almost completely ignored, even by UFO researchers, for more than thirty years. Then, in nineteen seventy-eight, nuclear physicist and author Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth. Over the next few years, the accounts he and others gave elevated Roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous UFO case of all time. By the early nineteen nineties, UFO researchers had interviewed several hundred people who had, or who claimed to have had, a connection with the events at Roswell in nineteen forty-seven. Additionally, hundreds of documents were obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests, as were some that insiders apparently leaked. Their conclusions were that at least one alien craft had crashed in the Roswell vicinity, that aliens, some possibly still alive, were recovered, and that a massive cover-up of any knowledge of the incident was put in place. Numerous books, articles, television specials and even a made-for-TV"
9,"Tulip mania was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed. At the peak of tulip mania in February sixteen thirty-seven, tulip contracts sold for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally considered the first recorded economic bubble. The tulip, introduced to Europe in the mid sixteenth century from the Ottoman Empire, became very popular in the United Provinces, which we now know as the Netherlands. Tulip cultivation in the United Provinces is generally thought to have started in earnest around fifteen ninety-three, after the Flemish botanist Charles de l'Ecluse had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established a botanical garden, which is famous as one of the oldest in the world. There, he planted his collection of tulip bulbs that the Emperor's ambassador sent to him from Turkey, which were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the northern climate. It was shortly thereafter that the tulips began to grow in popularity. The flower rapidly became a coveted luxury item and a status symbol, and a profusion of varieties followed. They were classified in groups: one-colored tulips of red, yellow, or white were known as Couleren, but it was the multicolored Rosen (red or pink on white background), Violetten (purple or lilac on white background), and, to a lesser extent, the Bizarden (red, brown or purple on yellow background) that were the most popular. These spectacular and highly sought-after tulip bulbs would grow flowers with vivid colors, lines, and flames on the petals, as a result, it is now understood, of being infected with tulip-specific virus known as the 'Tulip breaking virus'. The Dutch Golden Age growers named their new varieties with exalted titles. Many early forms were prefixed with 'admiral', often combined with the growers' names. 'General' was another prefix that found its way into the names of around thirty varieties. Later came varieties with even more superb names, such as even 'Admiral of Admirals' and 'General of Generals'. Most of these varieties have now died out, though similar 'broken' tulips continue in the trade. Tulips grow from bulbs, and can be propagated through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after seven-twelve years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original"
10,"Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, was named for Dr. Georges Gilles de la Tourette, the pioneering French neurologist who first described the condition in an eighty-six-year-old French noblewoman. It is almost always in childhood that the early symptoms of Tourette's are first noticed, with the average onset between the ages of seven and ten years. It is estimated that two hundred thousand Americans have the most severe form of Tourette's, and as many as one in a hundred people exhibit milder and less complex symptoms that include chronic motor and vocal tics or transient tics of childhood. For the majority of people diagnosed with the disorder, Tourette's is not a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime. Rather it is a condition whose severity peaks in the early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood. However, approximately ten percent of those affected have a progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood. It is not uncommon for symptoms to be present for an extended period of time before a formal diagnosis of Tourette's is obtained. The reasons for this are many and may include the fact that for families and physicians unfamiliar with Tourette's, mild and even moderate tic symptoms may be considered inconsequential, part of a developmental phase, or the result of another condition. For example, parents may think that eye blinking is related to vision problems or that sniffing is related to seasonal allergies. There are many patients who are self-diagnosed after they, their parents, other relatives, or friends read or hear about Tourette's from others. Tics are classified as either simple or complex. Simple motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements that involve a limited number of muscle groups. Some of the more common simple tics include eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Simple vocalizations, which motor tics typically precede, might include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds. Complex tics are distinct, coordinated patterns of movement that involve several muscle groups. Complex motor tics might include facial grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug. Other complex motor tics may actually appear purposeful, including sniffing or touching objects, hopping, jumping, bending, or twisting. Complex vocal tics include words or phrases. Perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics include motor movements that result in self-harm such as punching oneself in the"
